# Feedback and critique

## Hypertext Narrative Project

Students will be at varying levels of competency with regards to their technical and creative writing. In DMD 100, the type of feedback that is given should both **reinforce** what is being done correctly, highlight the specific **impact of existing writing** choices, and include **advice and rationale** for writing changes. Most of the advice given by instructors and assistants will be optional and at the student's discretion, but can be mandatory when called for. Instructional feedback is better as written text or in a form that can be referenced later. This will help instructors evaluate if students are interpreting and accounting for feedback.

The resulting outcomes of this project include the development of a story according to a project brief, gaining familiarity and practice with storytelling concepts, and improve understanding and practice feedback interpretation. The lesson topics will introduce the relevant theory and concepts needed to complete the project. Whenever possible, present a link to the lesson topics that cover overlooked story concepts for the student to read.

The following three categories should help with feedback provisioning, with some example concepts and story requirements to focus on:

### 1. Technical

1. Indicate is there are spelling and grammar issues.
2. Is the story finished enough for you to provide feedback?
3. Is writing and/or sentence structure awkward? Recommend rewrites where necessary.

### 2. Reader engagement

1. Is the “show, don’t tell principle being used to engage readers?
2. **Characters:**
   1. Are there archetypes or tropes that could be used? Are existing ones used well?
   2. Are character tropes used in an interesting way?
   3. Is there character development from beginning to end?
   4. Are characters too flat, round, etc? Could two characters be merged or a contrast character added?
3. Did the ending fall short? Is there something \(a joke, foreshadowing, etc.\) that you could set up earlier in the story to reference at the end?

### 3. Story concept

1. Is the story optimistic about the future and plausible? \(This is mandated in the project brief\)
2. **Research:**
   1. Does it seem like the student did enough research on the subject matter?
   2. Are referenced facts, truths, ideas, proclamations believable and accurate?
   3. Is the technology or moments of great change explained in enough detail? Some people like to gloss over a great moment of change, what should be the climax of the story is represented as a short, vague moment. When this is done, they often include references to impossible technology and fuzzy causal relationships. This is unfortunate because this moment is actually one of reasons the story was asked to be written in the first place — story as a speculative pattern for affecting positive future change.

## Open Design Project

The Open Design project aims to help students think about developing a prototype product with limited financial resources. Students are asked to create a kit of parts from inexpensive materials, and then produce instructions that will allow others to create what they have created. They are essentially creating a product, and knowledge itself.

### 1. Technical

1. Did student create a reconfigurable kit of parts?
2.
