# Feedback and critique

The goal of feedback in this course is to help novice students gain experience improving their work within a design process \(in this case the Double Diamond process\) and help give them early success in designing for a complex and ambiguous challenges to build confidence as a designer. Typically, if students follow the process, they will do well, but some may need help staying on task. In DMD100, we assume that all student projects are imperfect and can be better. While many of the project assignment submissions are simply a check to see that students are following the process, the first project iterations that occur during the develop steps of the project require thorough analysis and feedback, at great expense of time and effort from course instructors. Leave yourself plenty of time for grading these submissions. In later upper-level courses, students will be given more freedom to make their own decisions when provided with feedback. For the students who do wonderful visual and technical work, it may be best to push them on their conceptual skills \(to seek more novel ideas\) rather than their visual and aesthetic production.

In this 100 level course, students are instructed to make specific changes, and are held accountable for making those changes in future submissions. Giving specific advice and direction tests students' ability to accept and interpret feedback, familiarizing them with the idea that their best work will rarely occur on their first attempt. In this way, we are causing students to view their work more objectively, rather than encouraging them to form emotional attachments to their ideas. This is an important attitude to instill at this early stage in the program, and will allow for more open-minded ideation later in the curriculum. Most students will not have a problem adjusting to this process, though some may demand explanation.

Students should be held accountable to following assignment directions, paying attention to detail, fulfilling the spirit of the assignment, producing their own work, and making changes according to instructor comments. When a student has not submitted an assignment, a grade of zero should be made, with a note on the assignment that there is "no submission." This alerts the student that they may have accidentally not submitted an assignment, and that they currently have a zero. Withholding a grade obscures possible mistakes that could be corrected sooner rather than later.

## Ritual Project

Re-read the project brief. Some students do not pay attention to the brief and tend to stray from the requirements and constraints.  It's important that they be held accountable  as attention to detail is a vital skill. In DMD100, there are no expectations that students will have any prior creative software experience. They are expected to be able to use a computer, have the ability to navigate the web, and learn select software where directed. For the Ritual Project, students will be producing an interactive mockup with InvisionApp.com and some provided paper templates. Fortunately, this web application is very easy to learn and already has supporting tutorials. Beyond this tool, they will need to use unzipping tools and cropping tools that are included with their operating system.

### 1. Technical

* Are the "screens" straight, well lit, high enough resolution, and cropped to the correct aspect ratio?
* Did the student use InvisionApp's hotspot functionality to allow users to navigate?
* Did they submit the correct files and include change log docs where necessary?
* Does navigation feel intuitive, or is it overly complex?
* Can screens be merged together to simplify the app?
* Does the app have all of the features it should to reinforce the student's ideas?
* Did the student make enough of the screens operational? Does it feel complete?
* Did the student make a high fidelity prototype instead of the low fidelity prototype that was asked for? If they've used Photoshop or a full prototyping package like Sketch or Figma to produce rich graphics, they have gone a bit over what was asked.

### 2. Conceptual

* Is the app a todo or calendar app? If so, ask the student to rework their concept, students were asked not to produce these types of ideas in the brief.
* If the student is struggling, they can create an app that is inspired by the how might we question. This means, it does not have to be a literal response to the question, but perhaps an idea sparked by the question.

## Hypertext Narrative Project

Students will be at varying levels of competency with regards to their technical and creative writing. In DMD 100, the type of feedback that is given should both **reinforce** what is being done correctly, highlight the specific **impact of existing writing** choices, and include **advice and rationale** for writing changes. Most of the advice given by instructors and assistants will be optional and at the student's discretion, but can be mandatory when called for. Instructional feedback is better as written text or in a form that can be referenced later. This will help instructors evaluate if students are interpreting and accounting for feedback.

The resulting outcomes of this project include the development of a story according to a project brief, gaining familiarity and practice with storytelling concepts, and improve understanding and practice feedback interpretation. The lesson topics will introduce the relevant theory and concepts needed to complete the project. Whenever possible, present a link to the lesson topics that cover overlooked story concepts for the student to read.

The following three categories should help with feedback provisioning, with some example concepts and story requirements to focus on:

### 1. Technical

1. Indicate when there are spelling and grammar issues.
2. Determine if the story finished enough for you to provide feedback.
3. Is writing and/or sentence structure awkward? Recommend rewrites where necessary.

### 2. Reader engagement

1. Is the “show, don’t tell principle being used to engage readers?
2. **Characters:**
   1. Are there archetypes or tropes that could be used? Are existing ones used well?
   2. Are character tropes used in an interesting way?
   3. Is there character development from beginning to end?
   4. Are characters too flat, round, etc? Could two characters be merged or a contrast character added?
3. Did the ending fall short? Is there something \(a joke, foreshadowing, etc.\) that you could set up earlier in the story to reference at the end?

### 3. Story concept

1. Is the story optimistic about the future and plausible? \(This is mandated in the project brief\)
2. Does the student have the cultural authority needed to write a particular story? For instance, is the student writing about a foreign peoples or place with little firsthand knowledge, causing them to rely on stereotypes? This is often problematic, and should be pointed out immediately so the student can self-correct.
3. **Research:**
   1. Does it seem like the student did enough research on the subject matter?
   2. Are referenced facts, truths, ideas, proclamations believable and accurate?
   3. Is the technology or moments of great change explained in enough detail? Some people like to gloss over a great moment of change, what should be the climax of the story is represented as a short, vague moment. When this is done, they often include references to impossible technology and fuzzy causal relationships. This is unfortunate because this moment is actually one of reasons the story was asked to be written in the first place — story as a speculative pattern for affecting positive future change.

## Open Design Project

The Open Design project aims to help students think about developing a prototype product with limited financial resources. Students are asked to create a kit of parts from inexpensive materials, and then produce instructions that will allow others to create what they have created. Students are creating both a product and new knowledge. Feedback should be aimed at helping students develop interesting and novel ideas, as well as helping them articulate clear instructions for others to follow.

### 1. Technical

#### Instructions

1. Were instructions clear and spellchecked? 
2. Are instructions thorough enough? **\(Most aren't very detailed on the first pass\)**
3. Did they include images, diagrams, and relevant templates?
4. Is text legible and are all images free of distortion/stretching?
5. Is the document free of copyrighted materials? They are required to create materials they have designed but may pull in CC materials as needed. A significant portion \(90%\) of the project must be designed by the student.

#### Kit of parts

1. Did the student create a reconfigurable kit of parts? Can it be reconfigured into at least three things?
2. Did the project rely on readily available low cost or free materials?
3. Was it a weapon? If so, ask them to rework the project concept, this violates project requirements.

### 2. Concept

1. Did the project take an existing idea and add novel elements to it?
2. Is the project accomplishable without special skills or training?
3. Does the concept reference initial research and project pitch? Are project goals well articulated?
