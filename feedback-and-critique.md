# Feedback and critique

## Hypertext Narrative assignment

Students will be at varying levels of competency with regards to technical and creative writing. In DMD 100, the type of feedback that is given should both reinforce what is being done correctly, what isn't being done correctly along with the specific impact, and prescriptive or suggested advice for changes. Advice can be optional or mandated. Instructional feedback is better written as it can be referenced later on to evaluate if students are interpreting and accounting for feedback. Though the end result is better writing and understanding of concepts, they are also being evaluated on their ability to interpret feedback. The following three categories should help with feedback provisioning, with example feedback.

### 1. Technical

1. Please check for spelling and grammar issues and/or ask someone else to proofread.
2. This story is unfinished, so I am unable to give you much feedback.
3. Your writing and/or sentence structure is a bit awkward, consider rewriting.

### 2. Reader engagement

1. Is the “show, don’t tell principle being used to engage readers?
2. **Characters:**
   1. Are the archetypes correct and used well?
   2. Are character tropes used in an interesting way?
   3. Is there development of character from beginning to end?
   4. Are characters too flat, round, etc? Could two characters be merged or a contrast character added?
3. Did the ending fall short? Is there something \(a joke, foreshadowing, etc.\) that you could set up earlier in the story to reference at the end?

### 3. Story concept

1. Is the story optimistic about the future and plausible?
2. **Research:**
   1. Does it seem like the student did enough research on the subject matter?
   2. Are referenced facts, truths, ideas, proclamations believable and accurate?
   3. Is the technology or moments of great change explained in enough detail? Some people like to gloss a great moment of change, what should be the climax of the story, as a short moment. When this is done, they often include references to impossible, or fuzzy causes. This is unfortunate because this moment is actually one of reasons the story was asked to be written in the first place — story as a speculative schematic for affecting positive future change.
